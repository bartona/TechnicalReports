# TechnicalReports
These are pre-print copies of technical reports that I've written that have been made available for public release.  Due to long publishing delays, final versions will not be available on their respective proceedings until mid-2019.

Other public released technical reports that I have authored or co-authored, that have made it to DTIC as of Jan 2019 include:
